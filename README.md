As for some reason I don't know, when using Axmath to create TeX content including equations and descriptions, there's no option for you to copy your content into clipboard and directly paste it into LaTeX files while being compiled well. If you did so, what you get is just a bunch of things squeezed into one displayed equation.

So this is a simple & stupid python program to convert the thing you copied directly from Axmath to the combination of inline math and displayed math, which actually depends on what you wrote. In this way, you can write full paragraphs with words and TeX in Axmath, and then use this program to copy & paste those paragraphs into LaTeX documents.
